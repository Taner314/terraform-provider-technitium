# Technitium 14 vs 15

The provider supports Technitium **14.x and 15.x**; the CI tests every release against both.
Some features exist only on one of them.

| Feature | 14.x | 15.x |
|---|---|---|
| `technitium_sso` | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_general`: `enable_check_for_update`, `ipv6_mode`, `enable_edns_client_subnet_source_address`, `udp_send_buffer_size_kb`, `udp_receive_buffer_size_kb` | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_web_service`: `reverse_proxy_addresses`, `csp_frame_ancestors`, Unix sockets | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_protocols`: `enable_dns_over_http_help_redirect`, DoH Unix sockets | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_recursion.locally_served_dns_zones` | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_cache.enable_prefetch` | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_logging.no_stack_trace` | — | ✓ |
| `technitium_settings_cache.prefetch_sample_*` | ✓ | — |
| Internal zones listed by `technitium_dns_zones` | ✓ | hidden by the server |

On a server without a setting, its attribute reads as `null`; setting it fails at apply time with
an error naming the server version. Renamed settings (such as the DNS reverse proxy ACL) use one
attribute that works on both.

`technitium_server_info` exposes the server version if a configuration needs to adapt to it.
